# Affine Subspace

### Defination

- Let $V$ be a vector space. An **affine subspace** of $V$ is a subset $L$ such that there exists $v \in V$ and a vector subspace $U \sube V$ such that
  $$L = v + U := \{ v + u| u \in U\}$$
- An affine subspace $L$ is n-dimensional if the corresponding subspace $U$ is n-dimensional.
- The subspace $U$ corresponding to an affine subspace is unique.
- However the vector $v$ corresponding to an affine subspace is not unique.
- Affine subspaces are thus **_translation_** of vector subspace $V.$

### Solution set of a system of linear equations

- Let $Ax = b$ be a linear system of equations.
  - $b = 0:$ In this case, it is a homogeneous system and as seen
    before, the solution set is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$, namely the null
    space $A$.
  - $b \notin \text{ column space of } A$: In this case, $Ax = b$ does not have a solution, so the solution set is the empty set.
  - $b \in \text{ column space of } A$: In this case, the solution set L is an affine subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$. Specifically, it can be described as $L =  v + nullspace(A)$ where v is any solution of the equation $Ax = b.$

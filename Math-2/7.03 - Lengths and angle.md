# Lengths of Vectors

- Let us find the length of vector $(3,4)$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$
- Using Pythagoras' theorm the length of the vector $(3,4)$ is:
  - $\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5\text{ units}$

### Formula

- The Length of the vector is the **_Square root of it's Dot Product with itself._**
- $u \in \mathbb{R}^n$
  $$||u|| = \sqrt{u \cdot u}$$
